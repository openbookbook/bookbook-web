front-end for bookbook. written in react. typed with js-docs.

## technology
this ancient front-end was originally made with create-react-app. in october 2024 it was updated to use vite.

it does not utilize typescript but is moving towards type safety with js-docs which [is a full-featured alternative to typescript](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/4429#discussioncomment-2423814) that runs on the same engine!
